### Requirements
  * Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v5.0 or newer
  * `npm` v3.3 or newer (new to [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)?)

### Setup

#### 1. Run `npm install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file.

#### 2. Run `npm run enjoy`

Note that the `npm run enjoy` command build the app and launch it in browser.

Unfortunately have no time for tests, better design, responsive/adaptive and some functionality.
